White Pond likely originated as a wind-excavated depression in the Sandhills. White Pond is located in a commercially managed Pinus taeda forest, and the pond and surrounding property have been managed for at least 70 years for private hunting and fishing. Pinus echinata and Pinus palustris are also present near the site. P. palustris was probably dominant prior to land clearance. Quercus falcata, Carya, and Liquidambar sytraciflua grow on the low ground surrounding the pond, as do Acer rubrum, Vaccinium, and other mesic trees and shrubs. On exposed sandy soils east of the lake, Quercus laevis, Ceratiola ericoides, Selaginella arenicola, Opuntia, and lichens grow under open P. palustris canopy. The shallow western have of the pond is vegetated by emergent graminoids (Poaceae and Cyperaceae), while the deeper eastern half is dominated by floating-leaved macrophytes (Nymphaea odorata and Brasenia schreberi)."

The mountains are composed predominantly of granite with contact aureole schists at the margins. The steep sided valley was deepened by glacial activity during the last glaciation (Coxon et al. 2012). The valley is flooded by two lakes which are separated by an alluvial fan deposited by a stream flowing down the centre of the southern wall of the valley. The Lower Lake (Irish Grid ref: T 118 966; Long. 06°20’30”W Lat. 53°00’30”N) is bounded on its western margin by the alluvial fan, the north and south margins are the steep valley sides and the eastern margin at the mouth of the valley is formed by a delta derived from an earlier lake that filled the valley (Coxon et al. 2012). The Upper Lake flows into the Lower Lake via a river that has cut through the fan deposit. The Lower Lake is approximately 300 m long (east-west) and 150 m wide (north-south); water depth is 13 m at its deepest point. The Lower Lake lies at an altitude of 130 m OD. The valley walls are now covered by semi-natural oak woods and plantations of exotic conifers which open out onto mountain heathland at higher altitudes. During the last century, mining activity led to the lowering of the water level in the Lower Lake by two metres (Anon 1990). The coring site was on the western margin of the Lower Lake. This was in the shore zone that is seasonally flooded. Due to the lowering of the water level in the last century, the sediments were lacustrine (rather than alluvial fan) deposits and were overlain by peat."

The marsh is banked and divided by two smaller prograding river channels forming two waterlogged depressions. The modern marsh appears to have developed behind the southern levee of the main river and the northern levee of the smaller river bounded the marsh to the south. The marsh extends from the estuarine shoreline, marked at high tide (~0.4 m above mean sea level) by driftwood and estuarine detritus, ~135 m to the embankment of the surrounding hill slope. Below the embankment, the marsh reaches a maximum elevation of 3 m above the high tide mark. The topography of the remnant agricultural terrace features lie an additional 50 cm or more above the marsh surface. Tukou is fed by two permanent streams that drain the eastern catchment of Pera’u (650 m a.s.l.), the highest peak on the island. The vegetation of the water-logged marsh surface is currently dominated by introduced pastoral grasses (e.g. Briza minor L.) and adventive herbs (e.g. Calystegia soldanella (L.) R.Br. ex Roem. & Schult. and Commelina diffusa Burm.f.) with some indigenous sedges and rushes. The embankment on the periphery of the marsh has a vegetation cover of grass and naturalized trees.

The principal spring feeds a small perennial stream and marsh system that drains perpendicularly to the Verlorenvlei River. Somewhat below the elevation of the main road to Elands Bay, three supplementary springs breach the surface and contribute to the boggy colluvial-alluvial marsh that protrudes towards an indistinct junction with the Verlorenvlei River. The lobe-shaped marsh remains perched above the river and is mantled by reeds and sedges including: Typha latifolia, Juncus kraussii, Cyperus fastigiatus, Cyperus marginatus and Scirpus fluvitans, while Phragmites australis occupies the deeper standing water along the vlei transition itself at the southern end of the site."

The mountains are composed predominantly of granite with contact aureole schists at the margins. The steep sided valley was deepened by glacial activity during the last glaciation (Coxon et al. 2012). The valley is flooded by two lakes which are separated by an alluvial fan deposited by a stream flowing down the centre of the southern wall of the valley. The Lower Lake (Irish Grid ref: T 118 966; Long. 06°20’30”W Lat. 53°00’30”N) is bounded on its western margin by the alluvial fan, the north and south margins are the steep valley sides and the eastern margin at the mouth of the valley is formed by a delta derived from an earlier lake that filled the valley (Coxon et al. 2012). The Upper Lake flows into the Lower Lake via a river that has cut through the fan deposit. The Lower Lake is approximately 300 m long (east-west) and 150 m wide (north-south); water depth is 13 m at its deepest point. The Lower Lake lies at an altitude of 130 m OD. The valley walls are now covered by semi-natural oak woods and plantations of exotic conifers which open out onto mountain heathland at higher altitudes. During the last century, mining activity led to the lowering of the water level in the Lower Lake by two metres (Anon 1990). The coring site was on the western margin of the Lower Lake. This was in the shore zone that is seasonally flooded. Due to the lowering of the water level in the last century, the sediments were lacustrine (rather than alluvial fan) deposits and were overlain by peat."	"Haslett, J. et al.
